#### Explaining the lab

We will present below an illustrative simulation of the **Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma**, which turns out to be a cornerstone of high-dimensional probability and computer science, celebrated for its powerful and counter-intuitive result about **dimensionality reduction**. Since no complicated algorithm is required to find the "best" projection implementing the data reduction, as a simple random projection certainly works with very high probability, the lemma turns out to be not just a theoretical curiosity but a practical and efficient tool with many applications in various real-world scenarios such as:

  - **Machine Learning**, where it speeds algorithms whose implementation and efficiency rely on evaluating **Euclidean** distances (such as *k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)* and *support vector machines*,  among others).
  - **Data Streaming**, where it helps processing massive datasets not quite fitting into the available memory by still maintaining a low-dimensional "sketch" of the data.
  - **Compressed Sensing**, where it plays a key role in recovering sparse signals from a small number of measurements.
  
All the math needed to understand the analysis may be found in [@delima2025probab]; updates and corrections of this text may also be found in this repo (check the file "prob-notes-levi-arxiv-ff.pdf").  



#### A glimpse at the theory

Let us recall the precise statement of the Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma, which says: if  $\mathcal C=\{x_1,\cdots,x_n\}\subset\mathbb R^d$ is a collection of $n$ points then, given $\epsilon, \delta\in(0,1)$, there exist $k= O(\epsilon^{-2}\log (n/\delta))$ and a map $F:\mathbb R^d\to\mathbb R^k$ such that
	\[
		1-\epsilon\leq \frac{\|F(x_i)-F(x_j)\|^2}{\|x_i-x_j\|^2}\leq 1+\epsilon,  		
	\]
	for all $x_i\neq x_j$ in $\mathcal C$. 
	
Regarding this result, we make the following comments:	

  - In applications to Data Science [@vershynin2018high],[@blum2020foundations], the number $n$ of **samples** is much smaller than the number $d$ of **features**.
  - The remarkable aspect of the lemma is that if we allow for a controlled distortion $\epsilon>0$ on the ``approximate projection'' $F$, $\mathcal C$ has a sort of **intrinsic dimension** $k$ which scales as $\log n$ and happens to be completely insensitive to the ambient dimension $d$, which might even be infinite. This means that there exists a subset $\mathcal I\subset \{1,\cdots,p\}$ of indexes with $\sharp \mathcal I=d-k$ such that $y_j=0$ for all $y\in F(\mathcal C)$ and $j\in\mathcal I$. In other words, up to an overall distortion measured by $\epsilon$, $k=C\epsilon^{-2}\log n$, for some $C>0$,  turns out to be the number of relevant (nonzero) features of the elements of $\mathcal C$, hence the importance of the result for data reduction.
  - Although the lemma's statement is deterministic in nature, its standard proof  [@delima2025probab, chap. 5] employs the **probabilistic method**, which roughly consists of upgrading the assertion we intend to prove (the purely deterministic statement involving the ``approximate projection'' $F$)  to a random event (by turning $F$ into a random matrix) and then checking that the associated random event occurs with **positive** probability.

#### Starting the simulation

In order to run a simulation for the Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma, we construct a function which generates high-dimensional data (in dimension $d$), projects it down to a lower
dimension $k$ (by means of a random $k\times d$-matrix whose entries follow independent standard normals), and calculates the preservation of pairwise distances. We will provide the appropriate parameters

  - the number of points $n$;
  - the original high dimension $d$;
  - the error tolerance $\epsilon$ (between 0 and 1);
  - a numerical constant $C$ involved in the calculation of $k$;
  - the seed integer, for reproducibility,

and the simulation will return 
 
  -  A printable list containing the simulation results: the chosen initial parameters, the value of $k$ and the distance preservation percentage (in brief, a summary);
  - a ``ggplot`` object from which the actual plot can be extracted
   




```{r}
run_jl_simulation <- function(n, d, epsilon = 0.2, C = 15, seed = 42) {
  set.seed(seed)
  k <- ceiling(C * log(n) / epsilon^2)
  if (k >= d) {
    stop(sprintf(
      "Simulation stopped. The required dimension k=%d is not less than the original dimension d=%d. \nTry increasing d or n, or increasing epsilon.",
      k, d
    ))
  }
  X_original <- matrix(rnorm(n * d), nrow = n, ncol = d)
  projection_matrix <- matrix(rnorm(k * d), nrow = k, ncol = d)
  X_projected <- (X_original %*% t(projection_matrix)) * (1 / sqrt(k))
  dist_orig_sq <- as.matrix(dist(X_original)^2)

    preservation_percentage = preservation_pct,
    plot = jl_plot
  ))
}

  verification_text <- paste(
    "--- Verification of the JL Lemma ---",
    sprintf("Percentage of pairs preserved: %.2f%%", jl_results$preservation_percentage),
    sep = "\n"
  )
  # Convert each text block into a colored HTML block
  html_block1 <- create_colored_block(params_text, jl_summary_colors["params"])
  html_block2 <- create_colored_block(reduction_text, jl_summary_colors["reduction"])
  html_block3 <- create_colored_block(verification_text, jl_summary_colors["verification"])
  # Combine and print the final html
  final_html <- paste(html_block1, html_block2, html_block3, sep = "\n")
  knitr::asis_output(final_html)
}
```



We may now run the simulation with specified parameters and print the summary with the aimed results.


```{r, results='asis'}
jl_results <- run_jl_simulation(n = 200, d = 20000)
summarize_jl_results(jl_results)
```




Note that we prescribed $(n,d)=(200,20000)$ while keeping the remaining parameter vector $(\epsilon,C)=(0.2,15)$ as in default. In any case, 
we may now view the pertinent plot in order to visually confirm the $100.00\%$ of distance preservation between the set of projected pair of points.

```{r}
print(jl_results$plot)
```

We thus see that the distribution of distance ratios (after projection) remains entirely within the prescribed interval $[0.8,1.2]$, thus confirming JL.

We may now try other choices for the parameter $\epsilon$, the error tolerance, say by shrinking it a bit...

```{r, results='asis'}
jl_results <- run_jl_simulation(n = 200, d = 20000, epsilon=0.15)
summarize_jl_results(jl_results)
print(jl_results$plot)
```

...which again confirms JL.

We may instead substantially decrease $C$ to see what happens:


```{r, results='asis'}
jl_results <- run_jl_simulation(n = 200, d = 20000, C=5)
summarize_jl_results(jl_results)
print(jl_results$plot)
```


Since $C$ directly affects $k$, we see that by substantially reducing the projected dimension (from $k=1987$ to $k=663$) the distance ratios of a certain (albeit tiny) fraction of projected pairs (about $0.05\%$) fall **outside** the prescribed interval [0.8,1.2]. This clearly shows that the crucial input in determining the projected dimension $k$ is the term $\epsilon^{-2}\log n$, with $C$ being merely an adjusting factor.

Needless to say, you may keep playing around with other values for the input parameters but you should be aware that your computational power may easily fail if $d$ is chosen large enough. So go ahead at your own risk...
